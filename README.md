## Introduction ##

[awareNet](http://awarenet.org) is a suite of social networking software for schools, designed to create a safe environment where student communities at schools across the globe can interact.  It is written in PHP - based on the Kapenta framework - and runs on the LAMP stack.  Local awareNet installations at schools will be joined together as a peer-to-peer network, using scarce bandwidth only for messaging and synchronization of content.
