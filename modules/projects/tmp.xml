		<content><![CDATA[In the UK and Canada adult male chickens are known as cocks whereas in America and Australia they are called roosters. Males under a year old are cockerels.[6] Castrated roosters are called capons (though both surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females are pullets.[7] In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook (pronounced /ˈtʃʊk/: rhymes with "book") to describe all ages and both sexes.[8] Babies are called chicks, and the meat is called chicken.<br/><br/>"Chicken" was originally the word only for chicks, and the species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).
