Planned changes / improvements to the tags module

(*)	Add a precache for object counts of abritrary categories - at present Tags_Tag objects have
	objectCount and embedCount properties to record the number of objects indexed to the tag, and
	the number of those which can be embedded into user content (images, videos, slideshows, etc).

	In time, more categories will likely need to be recorded and it is inefficient to continue
	to add more fields and indexes to this table.  It is also logistically difficult as changes to
	table schema must be made simultaneously on peers run by different organizations.  Further, when
	ranking tags indexed to obejcts	of some type (projects, say), a sum operation is made on the
	index table.  This suffices for now but will not scale indefinitely, it is O(n) where an indexed
	precache would be O(log(n)).

(*)	Planned precache table:

		channel (VARCHAR(50))		- Precache label, eg, "embeddable objects"
		tagUID (VARCHAR(40))		- ref:Tags_Tag
		tagName	(VARCHAR(255))		- literal copy, to avoid join to second query
		objectCount (BIGINT)		- number of objects in this channel with this tag
		[default fields]
		shared						- no - tag precache applies to this peer only

(*)	Sharing: since different peers may have different collections of unshared objects which may
	be tagged, aggregate counts of available objects with that tag will differ between peers.  Thus
	the precache must be built and maintained separately on each peer in response to the creation
	and removal of Tags_Index objects.  Recounts should be triggered by database and p2p events.
